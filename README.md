# CalculatorWindows - Internship Project Showcase

## üéØ Overview

This repository contains a replica of the Windows OS Calculator, developed as part of my internship. This project demonstrates my ability to create functional desktop applications using Java and Swing. It highlights my understanding of GUI development, event handling, and implementing complex logic in a user-friendly interface.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **GUI Implementation**: Accurate recreation of the Windows Calculator interface using Swing.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Functions**: Includes square root, percentage, and memory functions.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Intuitive layout and responsive interaction for a seamless user experience which fully copies original UX.
- **Internship Project**: Successfully completed as an internship assignment, showcasing practical skills and problem-solving abilities.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Java**: Core language for building the application.
- **Swing**: Java GUI toolkit for creating the user interface.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool.
